Contributions should be made through pull requests. Each PR should consist of
a markdown file containing

1. a description of the dataset including a link to the appropriate publication or
reference.
2. direct links to download the count matrix (in the form of an easy-to-load file, like `rds` file containing an sparse matrix for R and an `AnnData` `hdf5` file or
  a `mtx` file for python.)
3. sample loading code for R and python.

An example is [datasets/tabula_muris.md](datasets/tabula_muris.md)

How easy can you make it for someone to get started?
