# Single-cell analysis of clonal dynamics in direct lineage reprogramming

10x scRNA-seq on ~90,000 cells from a timecourse of reprogramming of mouse embryonic fibroblasts to induced endoderm progenitor cells (iEPs). Cells were collected every 3 or 7 days, in two independent biological replicates. We also applied our lentiviral based clonal tracking tool, CellTagging, (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/04/28/127860) to define successful (and not so successful) reprogramming trajectories.

## Metadata

Metadata can be downloaded here: https://htcf.wustl.edu/files/lXrZ96Xg/. Included in this file are cell barcode ids, day of cell collection, clone id, and trajectory id. For trajectory id, we have identified two groups of clones that either 1) successfully reprogram, or 2) fail to reprogram and enter a ‘dead-end’.

## Use agreement
Although these data are being made publicly available as part of the CZI Computational Tools working group, the producers consider these data as unpublished and expect that the data will be used in accord with standard scientific etiquette and practices concerning unpublished data. Researchers are encouraged to use these data exclusively for the development of novel methods to analyze scRNA-Seq related to cell-cell variation, trajectory analysis and cell type identification/characterization. Use of these data for other purposes requires the explicit consent of the creators prior to an embargo date of January 1st, 2019.
