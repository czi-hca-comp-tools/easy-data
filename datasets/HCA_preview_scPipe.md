# HCA_Previewdata
Mixture data set from 3 human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (HCC827, H1975 and H2228) across different platforms: celseq2, dropseq, and 10x.

Data was downloaded from [HCA data portal](https://preview.data.humancellatlas.org/) and processed in [this repo](https://github.com/LuyiTian/HCA_Previewdata) using scPipe.

## Metadata

Metadata is stored in [HCA data portal](https://preview.data.humancellatlas.org/) and can be downloaded directly [here](https://preview.data.humancellatlas.org/datasets/melanoma/hca-metadata-melanoma.xlsx).

## Count files for R

You can find SingleCellExperiment object for the dataset, either the [raw data](https://github.com/LuyiTian/HCA_Previewdata/blob/master/rdata/ischaemic_sensitivity_raw.RData?raw=true) or [processed data](https://github.com/LuyiTian/HCA_Previewdata/blob/master/rdata/ischaemic_sensitivity_QC_norm.RData) after quality control and normalization are in the `rdata` folder.

## Exploratory data analysis

Rmd document can be found in `script` folder.

## CSV and MTX files

You can find gene count matrix in `data/<dataset_name>/gene_count.csv.zip`. Quality control metrics generated by scPipe during data preprocessing can be found in `data/<dataset_name>/stat`
