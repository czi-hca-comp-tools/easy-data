## `conquer`
 
 Mark Robinson and Charlotte Soneson have created the great [`conquer`](http://imlspenticton.uzh.ch:3838/conquer/) dataset, which has `MultiAssayExperiments` for about 38 single cell experiments with count level and consistently normalized data plus QC reports. [Here's a gist](https://gist.github.com/ivirshup/131a56175503a2408f814874925c19f9) which contains a python script (and conda requirements file) to pull down all those datasets.
 
 This data was aggregated for use in: [Bias, robustness and scalability in single-cell differential expression analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4612).
